 Financial Ratios Analyzer

Welcome to the Financial Ratios Analyzer! This program is designed to help you evaluate a company's financial health by calculating key financial ratios based on its financial statements. Whether you're an investor looking for insights or just curious about a stock, this tool can assist you in making informed decisions.

## What It Does

The Financial Ratios Analyzer fetches a company's financial data, calculates important ratios like the Current Ratio, Debt to Equity, Return on Equity, and more. It then uses AI to provide a recommendation on whether to buy, hold, or sell the stock based on these ratios.

## How It Works

1. **Data Retrieval:** The program uses the `yfinance` library to gather financial data for a specified stock ticker.
2. **Ratio Calculation:** It computes various financial ratios that provide insights into liquidity, profitability, and overall financial stability.
3. **AI Recommendation:** Leveraging Google Generative AI, it generates a recommendation based on the calculated ratios.

## Getting Started

To run the program, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install yfinance google-generativeai numpy
```

Once you have the dependencies set up, just run the script and input the stock ticker you want to analyze when prompted. For example, you can input `AAPL` for Apple Inc.

```bash
python financial_ratios_analyzer.py
```

## Example Output

When you run the program, you might see output similar to this:

```
Hello, what is the ticker you want to analyze? AAPL

AI Recommendation for AAPL based on financial ratios:
Based on the analysis of AAPL's financial ratios, it is recommended to hold the stock.
```
